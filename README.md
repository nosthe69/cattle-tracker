# 🐄 Cattle Tracker App
# 📍 Problem
# In many South African rural communities, cattle ownership is deeply tied to culture, economy, and daily life. However, tracking and recovering missing cattle is a constant challenge, especially in remote areas where traditional tracking methods are time-consuming and unreliable.
# This can lead to significant financial losses and emotional stress for families and farmers who depend on livestock for income and food security.

# 💡 Solution
# The Cattle Tracker App offers a practical and digital solution to this pressing issue. It leverages Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to help farmers record, track, and potentially recover lost cattle more efficiently.
# By digitizing cattle records and streamlining tracking processes, the app helps farmers protect their herds — and their livelihoods — using accessible mobile technology.
